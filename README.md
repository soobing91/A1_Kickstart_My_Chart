# Kickstart My Chart

Using Microsoft Excel, various visualizations are created to reveal relationships among various factors that lead to successful kickstarter projects.

1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
    1. “Theatre” is the most launched parent-category and resulted in most “Successful” and “Failed” campaign among other categories.
    2. Among sub-categories, “Plays” is launched the most.
    3. The number of campaigns launched is the lowest in December and those of failed campaigns are more than those of successful campaigns.

2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?
    * The dataset contains factors that are only related to balances, dates, number of backers, and categories. Therefore, in-depth analyses on what could affect campaigns such as key demographics (age, sex, geography, etc.), environment, costs to promotion, etc. are unavailable at this stage.

3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    1. A series of pie charts showing goal proportions of sub-categories of each parent category per year
    2. A scatter plot showing the relationship between the number of supporters and status of campaign
